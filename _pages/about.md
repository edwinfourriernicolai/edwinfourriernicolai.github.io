Welcome to my webpage. I am an economist using data science to study firms, households and public policies. 

I obtained my PhD in 2019 from the [Aix-Marseille School of Economics](https://www.amse-aixmarseille.fr/en) at the *Aix-Marseille University* (France) and I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at the [GREDEG](https://gredeg.univ-cotedazur.fr/) and the [EUR ELMI](https://elmi.univ-cotedazur.fr/) at the *Université Côte d'Azur* (France).

I am a member of the *Chair of Economics of AI and Innovation* headed by Simone Vannuccini.

My different professional experiences have allowed me to develop my expertise in economic theory, statistics, empirical methods, as well as my skills in programming, communication and project management.

**Research interests:** Data science, Econometrics, Economics, Innovation
