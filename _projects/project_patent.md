In today's rapidly evolving digital age, the emergence of groundbreaking technologies such as robotics, big data, vritual reality and the Internet of Things is reshaping industries and everyday life. These innovations hold the potential to revolutionize sectors from healthcare to manufacturing, enhance productivity, and create new opportunities for growth and development. However, despite the increasing interest and investment in these digital technologies, comprehending their diffusion remains difficult.

To bridge this gap, we have developed a comprehensive webapp that leverages patent data to track and analyze the diffusion of some cutting-edge technologies. By examining patent trends, we can uncover patterns and shifts, offering a clearer picture of how these technologies are spreading and evolving.

This webapp aims to share with other researchers, experts and a wider public the results of our research carried out at the *University of Trento* with *Mauro Caselli* and *Andrea Fracasso* in an accessible and engaging format. Whether you are a policymaker, researcher, business leader, or technology enthusiast, this tool allows you to explore the dynamics of technology diffusion. We invite you to delve into our dashboard and discover the transformative journey of these pivotal technologies.

Please note that this is a work in progress, and we welcome all constructive feedback to improve its functionality and content. Additionally, the dashboard may require a few minutes to load the first time you access it, so we appreciate your patience.
