One of the main challenges for sustainable agriculture lies in maximizing yields while preserving the environment through a minimal use of resources. Digital transformation can help to address this challenge and it is the main strategy promoted by the European Union in this perspective.

While internet plays a central role in information gathering as well as enabling the adoption of smart farming technologies, and despite the growing interest from researchers and policy makers, the impact of Internet access on farm production and its environmental impact remain unknown. 

The aim of this project is to estimate the effect of internet access on agricultural production by combining Italian data from agricultural surveys with internet coverage data. Specifically, this project proposes to examine whether access to the internet increases agricultural productivity, employment, diversification of productive activities and reduces environmental consequences (e.g. use of water, phytosanitary and fertilizing products, pollution, ...). This project has led to collaborations with *Mauro Caselli* (Università di Trento) as well as *Lorien Sabatino* and *Carlo Cambini* (Politecnico di Torino). First results have led to the writing of a policy report and of academic working papers.
